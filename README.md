# chomp

Chomp game, inspired by the interactive problem from Caribou Math Contests. The user inputs the dimensions of the grid, and is always allowed to go first. Click on a square to take all squares to the right and bottom of the square as well as the square itself. The user takes turns making moves with the computer, and the goal is to not take the top left square.
